            <h2>What is Depression?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>An estimated 3.8% of the world's population suffers from depression, with 5.0% of adults and 5.7% of persons over 60 years of age being affected . Around 280 million individuals worldwide suffer from depression . Depression is distinct from common mood swings and fleeting emotional reactions to problems in daily life. Depression may develop into a significant medical illness, especially if it is recurrent and of moderate to severe degree. The affected person may experience severe suffering and perform poorly at job, in school, and in the family. Suicide can result from depression at its worst. Every year, around 700,000 people die by suicide. For people aged 15 to 29, suicide is the fourth most common cause of death.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Although there are known, effective treatments for mental disorders, more than 75% of people in low- and middle-income countries receive no treatment .  Barriers to effective care include a lack of resources, lack of trained health-care providers and social stigma associated with mental disorders. In countries of all income levels, people who experience depression are often not correctly diagnosed, and others who do not have the disorder are too often misdiagnosed and prescribed antidepressants</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Symptoms and Patterns</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A depressive episode lasts at least two weeks and is characterised by a depressed mood (sad, irritated, or empty feelings) or a lack of enjoyment or interest in activities for the majority of each day. Other signs may include difficulty concentrating, feelings of overwhelming guilt or low self-worth, a lack of hope for the future, suicidal or death thoughts, disturbed sleep, changes in food, and feeling particularly exhausted or low on energy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some people may exhibit their mood swings more readily through physical symptoms in certain cultural circumstances (e.g. pain, fatigue, weakness). But no other medical issue is to blame for these physical symptoms.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The individual has severe trouble functioning in their personal, familial, social, academic, occupational, and/or other key domains during a depressed episode.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Depending on the frequency and intensity of symptoms, the influence on the person's functioning, as well as the length of the event, a depressive episode can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe.
                <br>
                <br>
                •   There are various mood disorder patterns, including:
                <br>
                
                •   Single episode depression (i.e., the individual's initial and sole episode)
                <br>
                
                •   Recurrent depression, which means the individual has experienced at least two depressive episodes in the past; and
                
                <br>
                •   With bipolar disorder, manic symptoms, such as euphoria or irritability, increased activity or energy, and other symptoms like increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and impulsive reckless behaviour, alternate with periods of depressive symptoms.
                </p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Contributing factors and prevention.</h2>
                <br>
                <p>A complex interplay of social, psychological, and biological variables causes depression. Depression is more prone to occur in people who have experienced catastrophic circumstances, such as unemployment or bereavement. Depression can exacerbate an individual's current situation and the depression itself by increasing stress and dysfunction. There are connections between physical health and depression. For instance, depression can result from cardiovascular disease, and vice versa.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Programs for prevention have been demonstrated to lessen depression. School-based initiatives to improve children's and teenagers' good coping behaviours are examples of effective community initiatives to avoid depression. Interventions for parents of kids with behavioural issues may lessen their depression symptoms and enhance their kids' outcomes. Exercise programmes for seniors can be helpful in preventing depression.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Diagnosis and treatment</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Healthcare providers may prescribe antidepressant drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants in addition to psychological therapies like behavioural activation, cognitive behavioural therapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy, depending on the severity and pattern of depressive episodes over time (TCAs). Bipolar disorder is treated with several drugs. The potential side effects of antidepressant medication, the ability to administer either intervention (in terms of skill, and/or treatment availability), and individual preferences should all be taken into consideration by healthcare professionals. Individual and/or group face-to-face psychological therapies provided by trained professionals and under the supervision of lay therapists are among the several psychological therapy modalities to be taken into account. For mild depression, antidepressants are not usually the first course of treatment.

        <center><h1>Anxiety</h1></center>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It's common to have uneasiness every now and then. Many people fret about things like their health, their finances, or their family issues. However, anxiety disorders go beyond momentary apprehension or terror. For those who suffer from an anxiety disorder, the anxiety persists and may even worsen with time. The symptoms might affect daily tasks including work performance, academic progress, and interpersonal connections.
            Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and numerous phobia-related illnesses are only a few of the several forms of anxiety disorders.
            <br>
            <br>
            A generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterised by a continuous sensation of fear or worry that might interfere with day-to-day activities. It is not the same as occasionally worrying or feeling anxious as a result of demanding life situations. For months or perhaps years, people with GAD endure regular anxiety.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Symptoms of GAD include</h2>
            <br>
            •	Feeling restless, wound-up, or on-edge
            <br>
            •	Being easily fatigued
            <br>
            •	Having difficulty concentrating
            <br>
            •	Being irritable
            <br>
            •	Having headaches, muscle aches, stomachaches, or unexplained pains
            <br>
            •	Difficulty controlling feelings of worry
            <br>
            •	Having sleep problems, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep

            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Panic Disorders</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Panic episodes happen often and without warning in people with panic disorder. Even when there is no obvious risk or trigger, panic attacks are abrupt episodes of great anxiety, discomfort, or a sensation of losing control. Not everybody who has a panic episode goes on to have a panic disorder.
                <br>
                <br>
During a panic attack, a person may experience:
<br>
<br>
•	Pounding or racing heart
<br>
•	Sweating
<br>
•	Trembling or tingling
<br>
•	Chest pain
<br>
•	Feelings of impending doom
<br>
•	Feelings of being out of control
<br>

            <h2>When to see a doctor</h2>
            <br>
            <p>See your doctor if:</p>
            <br>
            <p>•You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life</p> 
            <br>
            <p>•Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control</p> 
            <br>
            <p>•You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety</p> 
            <br>
            <p>•You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem</p> 
            <br>
            <p>•You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors — if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately</p> 
            <br>
            <p>Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It's easier to treat if you get help early.</p>
